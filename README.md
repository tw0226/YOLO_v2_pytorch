# YOLO_v2_pytorch

Didn't used Non-Maximum Suppression


<h1>Usage</h1>

(If you want <b>test one image training</b> or <b>one image show with pre-trained weight</b>)

1. In demo.py, input your folder_path and image name.
2. If you want train, set training=True, else you test one image.
3. run demo.py


<h1>caution</h1>

you can use this, but you need to implement additional code.(NMS, data augmentation, accuracy code)
because i didn't apply data augmentation, can't expect high accuracy.
This is just simple implementation, helping your understand.
